You can drop the STL files into the slicer of your choice and print the case in whatever material you'd like. I used the PETG and standard settings, but change the temp to 240 C on the extruder and 80 C on the bed. If you'd like to modify the model for a custom add on, you can open up the f3d file in fusion and modify the design. If you have any questions, reach out to @WW in the Mycelium Discord.
